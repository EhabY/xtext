 * 
 * All fields become final and a getter method is added.
 * The fields' name are prepended with an underscore (i.e. myField becomes _myField)
 * One constructor for initializing the fields is added.
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode()} implementations are added.
 * {@link Object#toString()} implementation is added.
